# Building a Modern Checklist App: MCP Integration, Modular Architecture, and Real-Time Updates

## Overview

I decided to make a quick MCP server for a checklist app. I found my coding agent had a hard time doing complex things. It would forget, or get stuck in loops. The checklist app
allows the agent to create a modify a list of things to do. Then it can read from the list / run down it. This helps guide it, producing more accurate results with fewer bugs. I use it by first asking it to create a list of steps for itself. Then I check the list and make sure the items make sense. Then I ask it to run down the list, checking in with me at all points. If it ever makes a mistake, I just nudge it in the right direction. By breaking things down first and checking in at regular intervals, the agent can produce much better code, and complete much larger features much faster. At this point, I am more of an architech than I am a developer.

A key feature I really wanted was infinitely expandable items. Items can have sub-items listed underneath them. This way if a task is too complex, I can ask the agent to break it down
even further. This can go on forever, meaning arbitrariliy complex features can be planned thoroughly before starting (in record time too).

The tech stack is simple. SQLite for the database, and Express to expose CRUD operations. Vite + Typescript SWC + Shadnc + Tailwind for the website, as well as websockets for realtime updates, and Node.js for the model context protocol.

This means three servers run when the MCP is used. One for the DB, one for the website, and one for the model context protocol. However, there is a central script which manages the installation of all packages and the running of all programs.

## ðŸ¤– Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Implementation

The model context protocol was almost entirely done by AI. It was a series of repetitive function definitions and lots of data-formatting, validation, and error handling. The kind of stuff that AI is perfect at doing. I later had to come in and refactor heavily, but using my new tool I was able to cut down the 900 line file into a very neatly organized project almost purely with AI. Something that could not have been done without something to guide the agent.

# Database Implementation

The database was the easiest part of the whole process. I went with SQLite, since it's more-than fast enough and everything is going to run locally anyway. The db structure is simple too. There are lists, and each list has list items. Each list item can optionally have a parent. When a user fetches list data, I simply get all list items belonging to a list, then convert the flat list of
list items into a tree structure which can be easily rendered on the website using a recursive react component.

# Website Implementation

This part took the longest, but because I have made many websites at this point, it was pretty fast. It took maybe 7 hours. First, I set up data fetching + websocket support. Whenever the database server recives a request to update data, it pings all websocket connections that there was a change. This is how the website is able to update in real time when the agent makes changes to the list data. Then I built some simple UI to visualize and interact with the lists.
