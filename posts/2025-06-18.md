## The Problem & Vision

I wanted to make a semantic search system beyond simple keyword matching so that anyone could come to my site and find
relevant posts without knowing exactly what to ask for. Google has lots of data to work off of, and I don't, so I have to do
things purely mathematically. However, pure keyword matching isn't great for searching in this way. So semantic searching is perfect.

## Technical Foundation

`@xenova/transformers` was the first thing I could find, and seems to be the best for the browser. So the first thing I did for this project
was set up a build script that runs through all my readme files and encodes them into semantic meanig so I can later query against those encoded meanings with the same model. This worked ok...
The main problem was that since I could only use a 20MB model in the browser (anything large would be too slow to download), the amount
of context it could work with was very small.

## The Chunking Breakthrough

By switching to 40-80 word chunks, with all markdown characters and filler words removed, I gave my 'search engine' more to work with. Instead of
trying to encode 300 words into 300 data points, it only had to encode 80 or so. Much more accurate results ensued. Though it still wasn't perfect.
Single word searches didn't always work.

## Hybrid Search Implementation

The semantic model worked by encoding the data into a list of 384 numbers. Then, when a user types in a search, I run the search through the same model and use the standard cosine simliarity algorithm to find the most similar results. This worked alright as well, but fell short on single word searches for unusual terms (like tailwind or shadcn/ui)

## UX & Interaction Design

I also did a bit of UX and UI design. I went with a large title and hero text, with a search bar underneath and a list of cards. When you type in a search result, it submits the search, runs some code, and then returns the filtered results. Nothing crazy. I made the search auto clear, and everything relies upon a constisent style defined in my index.css file.

## Component & State Architecture

For the project structure, I have a simple breakdown of Header, SearchBar, BlogPostCards, and BlogPostArea. Then I have a usePosts hook which
uses zustand for central state management.

## Visual Polish & Animations

I plan on using framer motion to animate everything soon!

## Key Lessons Learned

I learned a ton today. I learned about using AI models both in the browser and in a nodejs project using transformers.js. I gained some
experience with design since I've never designed a blog site. I had to do a bunch of debugging trying to figure out why the models wouldn't load
(turns out it was an issue with vite, and the solution was that you either had to turn off browser caching when using vite dev or build the project and serve it using a different tool??). Fun!
